# CrossmintCodingChallenge-
1. Ideally would like to separate the logic of the objects which are internal objects used for server side logic
(calculating spin of the planets, trajectory, etc) and the API logic (getParams and geURL) but since these objects are being
used currently to communicate with the API only, I have integrated the logic for convenience.

2. This code is untested - after completing the challenge, I revised the code significantly to implement the class logic
and the re-try logic, but the server was down (error 500) and I couldn't get the goal map, hence there might be some errors,
but the would love to discuss the overall logic.
